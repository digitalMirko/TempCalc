# TempCalc
Swift - Temperature Calculator App

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

This is a simple Temperature calculator app you could use on your iOS device. All a user needs to do is just click on the 
'Temp Calc' icon and they are taken right into the app. The first thing you see is the title on top 'Temp Calc'. Right 
below are some instructions on what to put in the textfield right below. Then in the middle of the app is the Thermometer
graphic which goes up and down depending on the results. Right under that is your results in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.
Just below your results is a label that has some information on the result temperature when its available. At the bottom
is a segmented control with the options: Calculate to °C or Calculate to °F.

Its a fun and easy to use app for all ages.
